A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government.
It can only exist until the voters discover they can vote
themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that
moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates
promising them the most benefits from the public treasury,
with the result that a democracy always collapses over a
loss of fiscal responsibility, always followed by a
dictatorship. The average of the world's great
civilizations before they decline has been 200 years.
These nations have progressed in this sequence:
From bondage to spiritual faith; from spiritual faith
to great courage; from courage to liberty; from liberty
to abundance; from abundance to selfishness; from
selfishness to complacency; from complacency to apathy;
from apathy to dependency; from dependency back again
to bondage.

From "The Decline and Fall of the Athenian Republic",
by Alexander Fraser Tytler, 1776
