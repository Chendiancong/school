Lab 1 - readme

To run this program, I would compile using the -o flag.  I would simply
type..

g++ -o Mark main.cpp Mark.cpp
Mark

...to run my program.  The input file names that are being looked for
are StudentFile.txt and TeacherFile.txt where an error is outputted
if the files are not found.  Those files as named, contain the data
given in the lab details on WebCT.  I have created two new files,
named StudentFile2.txt and TeacherFile2.txt.  I have run the program
with both sets of input files and recorded their output.  The output
file is CalculatedGrades.txt and it will be created if it does not
already exist.  I have renamed the output file for my set of input files
to CalculatedGrades2.txt.  Lastly, I have saved the output to the
console in two more separate files named
CalculatedGrades_console_output.txt and
CalculatedGrades2_console_output.txt.
