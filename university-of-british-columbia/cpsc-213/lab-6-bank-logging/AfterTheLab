After The Lab

1.  'bankKey' is doing a simple transaction, transferring funds
    from account 2 to account 1.

2.  In this scenario, incorrect balances may be written to the account.
    This is because if a balance is read from an account after a new
    balance is written to it, it will have recorded an 'old' (ie incorrect)
    balance.  Therefore, it will calculate an incorrect new balance, and
    write an incorrect new balance to file.

3.  The transaction ID's must be unique in order for the logfile to be used
    properly.  It must be able to identify each transaction individually so
    that it knows which processes were completed successfully, and which were
    terminated prematurely.

4.  Locking the 'recordlog ()' function at the beginning of the file is
    important because it is an easy place to check if the file is in 
    use (and therefore locked) or not.  Only one byte is necessary because
    it may act as a marker for other files to check, rather than other files
    checking the entire file.

5a. If a process is scheduled to log the processes of a transaction before
    the particular process has occurred, and the transaction is terminated
    in between, then the log file and the actual most recent state of the
    transaction are not the same.  This will result in inconsistency.

 b. The 'fsync ()' function hold the processes until all writes to disk
    are completed.
