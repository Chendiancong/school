1.  The fileIO's performance does depend on the block size.  This is because
    it makes more simultaneous system calls to perform more each step.

2.  The calls to fwrite and fread were significantly faster than the calls to 
    write and read.

3.  Using the same machine for all of the tests for part III ensures that the results
    are consistent.  Using a different machine would give different times for
    each command call.
