To the markers...

For the most part, I have managed to get my program to decode one
endian type.  However, after writing the function to decode the data,
I found that it will decode the sample file which is little
endian (sample.dat).  This did not surprise me since my home
computer, which I was working from, was little endian as well.  But,
when I went to test the program on the UNIX servers at school via
SecureCRT, I found that it worked on there as well.  This surprised
me because the UNIX system uses big endian and conflicts with the
data endianness.  From there on, I could not figure out why this was
so, so I was unable to work on switching from little endian to big
endian, and vice versa.

For the makefiles, I think I was able to comlete at least part of them,
but to compile the actual program to test, I would type in...

gcc -o decoder decoder_driver.c decoder.c dsupport.c endian.c
decoder <FILENAME>
