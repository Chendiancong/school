2.4 Constraints

2.4.1 Hardware limitations

	The system is designed to run on Machintosh G5 running on Mac OS X 10.2.8.

2.4.2 Software lImitations

	The system should be developed in an interpretive language and should be platform independent.

	The following software is needed in order to run the applications:
