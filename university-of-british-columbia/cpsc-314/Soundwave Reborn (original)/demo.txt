What we did...
  -articulated joint movements (key listeners for most joints)
  -dynamic camera views
  -transparency
  -culling and clipping panes to make scene
  -anti-aliasing for wire-frame mode
  -fog
  -skybox
  -lighting
  -spotlighting


What is in the demo...
  -transformations (full transformations and partial backflip)
  -dynamic camera views (trying to emulate FPS type camera controls)
  -transparency
  -culling and clipping
  -anti-aliasing for wire-frame mode
  -fog (default is disabled)
  -skybox
  -lighting
  -particle system (to simulate sparks coming from shoulders while rotating arms)


What is not in the demo...
  -lighting
  -spotlighting
    *lights just interfered with the skybox for some reason
  -skybox with star texture (too dark without lighting)
  -particle system with textured sparks (orange and with position relative to character)


What we wanted to do...
  -model head, hands, and weapons
  -sound using openal
  -texture the particles
  -better camera actions
  -reflections on chest plate
  -shadows
  -texture actual figure
  -limit fog to outside the dome
  -have the skybox and the lights on at the same time
  -collision detection
